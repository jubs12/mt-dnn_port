57437143c7f7495f95b8f52696c8865e	The first known tool for computing was the abacus, whose invention is attributed to inhabitants of Mesopotamia, around 2700–2300 BC. Its original use was to draw lines in the sand with rocks. More modern versions of the abacus are still used as a calculation tool. In the 7th century BC, in ancient India, the grammarian Pānini formulated Sanskrit grammar using 3959 rules known as Ashtadhyāyi, in a very systematic and technical way. Pānini used transformations and recursion with such sophistication that his grammar possessed theoretical computational power just like the Turing Machine. Between 200 BC and 400, Indians also invented the logarithm, and from the 13th century on, logarithmic tables were produced by Islamic mathematicians.

497bc26ae5ca4f26b3875acbfb2b431e	Around the 3rd century BC, the Indian mathematician Pingala invented the binary numbering system. Still used today in the processing of all modern computers, the system establishes that specific sequences of ones and zeros can represent any information. In 1703 Gottfried Leibniz developed logic in a formal and mathematical sense, using the binary system. In your system, ones and zeros also represent concepts such as true and false, on and off, valid and invalid. More than a century later, George Boole published Boolean algebra (in 1854), with a complete system that allowed the construction of mathematical models for computational processing. In 1801, the loom controlled by perforated cardboard appeared, invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard, in which holes indicated ones and, unpunched areas, indicated zeros.

In your system, ones and zeros also represent concepts such as true and false, on and off, valid and invalid. More than a century later, George Boole published Boolean algebra (in 1854), with a complete system that allowed the construction of mathematical models for computational processing. In 1801, the loom controlled by perforated cardboard appeared, invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard, in which holes indicated ones and, unpunched areas, indicated zeros. The system is far from a computer, but it illustrated that machines could be controlled by the binary system.What did the untapped areas indicate on the loom controlled by perforated cardboard?	zeros	zeros	zeros

1d27e2dc7a8e4014ae7e22f34b8fbd28	The mathematical foundations of modern Computer Science began to be defined by Kurt Gödel with his incompleteness theorem (1931). This theory shows that there are limits to what can be proven or disapproved in a formal system; this led to further work by Gödel and other theorists to define and describe such formal systems, including concepts such as recursion and lambda calculus. In 1936 Alan Turing and Alonzo Church independently, and also together, introduced the formalization of an algorithm, defining the limits of what can be a computer and a purely mechanical model for computing. Such topics are addressed in what is currently called the Church-Turing Thesis, a hypothesis about the nature of mechanical calculating devices. This thesis defines that any possible calculation can be performed by an algorithm running on a computer, as long as there is enough time and storage for that.Which theorem led to the definition of concepts such as recursion and lambda calculus?	incompleteness theorem	incompleteness theorem	incompleteness theorem

A workshop, volunteer work or even a seminar are examples of outreach activities. The most famous and sought after among the options is the internship. This is because it is a way to combine the useful with the pleasant. After all, most companies do not request professional experience at the time of hiring and nothing better than getting credits for college and learning a little in practice at the same time. However, in many courses, the internship is not a free complementary activity, that is, it is a requirement of the course. By law, undergraduate students, for example, are required to complete 400 hours of supervised internship from the middle of the course.

This is extremely important because, as professionals, we face all the time with doubts and questions that we do not know how to solve. Understanding different forms of research helps us to search for answers more precisely in order to achieve our goals. Some colleges accept scientific initiation or academic research as complementary activities. Which makes them a good option, as it is interesting to put your scientific side into practice, without the pressure of having to impress the professor to get a good grade for that subject.

The knowledge area is well focused and constitutes a subset of the professional area (the one studied throughout an undergraduate course). In addition to more advanced disciplines, which include a significant portion of individual bibliographic research and interpretation work, an initiation work on scientific research is developed. It is expected that at the end of the course the student will have acquired the ability to develop autonomous work. This work is characterized by the search for references, methods and current technologies and its application in a creative way. It is also expected to demonstrate the ability to write scientific texts. This ability is evidenced, mainly, by the text of the master's dissertation.

Direct entry to the doctorate is aimed at scientific research instead of teaching as in the case of the master's degree. The development agencies, which in the 1980s and 1990s encouraged Brazilians to go abroad for a doctorate, concluded in the last decade that Brazil already has doctoral courses of sufficient quality so that it is possible to take them in the country and no more abroad. While the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and the Research Support Foundation of the State of São Paulo grant very few doctoral scholarships abroad, the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel maintains concessions, but in a number that tends to decrease. The priority of the agencies, currently, is the granting of sandwich internships, that is, of periods of six months to an academic year so that the doctoral student, registered in Brazil, can contact advanced centers abroad and make contacts that then it will develop [citation needed].

Enrollments usually take place in the same period as the Master's Selection Process. After selection of the approved regulars, the non-regular candidate may enroll in both disciplines without, however, having any effective link with the Higher Education Institution. Later, you can request the use of the two subjects taken as a Special Student in your undergraduate course (provided you have completed high school) or postgraduate (provided you have completed graduation) until the date of enrollment, otherwise you will not be able to ask use of the subjects taken, as these will only be used as an extracurricular teaching and extension activity.What happens if the Special Student does not require the use of the two subjects taken until the enrollment date?	these will only apply as an extracurricular teaching and extension activity	these will only apply as an extracurricular teaching and extension activity	these will only apply as an extracurricular teaching and extension activity

7a50b2ccd7b9424f87bf312e60fc9a44	Several different models of computation have been proposed by the first researchers. One model, known as Turing machine, proposed the construction of a universal machine capable of operating with a sequence of instructions and data intermixed on a tape of infinite length; the machine could operate on a point on the tape at a time using a head for reading and writing, so running the program that you are last. Another model is based on recursive composite functions to operate directly on the numbers. A similar approach is the lambda calculus. Another class of approaches works with grammar rules operating on strings, as in the case of Markov chains and Post systems.What computational model proposed the construction of a universal machine capable of operating with a sequence of instructions?

The first real machine was built by Wilhelm Schickard being able to add, subtract, multiply and divide. This machine was lost during the Thirty Years War, and recently found some documentation on it. For many years nothing was known about this machine, therefore, attributed to Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) the construction of the first calculating machine, which was only additions and subtractions. Pascal machine was created in order to help his father to compute taxes in Rouen, France. Pascal's design has been greatly enhanced by the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1726), who also invented calculus, which dreamed that one day in the future, all reasoning could be replaced by the spin of a single lever.

7c6762138ebb4e20b4c16479233b4031	The first computer electromechanical was built by Konrad Zuse (1910-1995). In 1936, this German engineer built from relays who performed the calculations and read data on punched tape, the Z1. Zuse tried to sell the computer to the German government, which spurned the offer, since there would help in the war effort. The Zuse projects would be stopped during the war, giving a chance to the Americans to develop their computers. It was in World War II that really born today's computers. The US Navy, in conjunction with Harvard University, developed the computer Harvard Mark I, designed by Professor Howard Aiken, based on analytic calculator of Babbage. The Mark I occupied about 120m³, managing to multiply two ten-digit numbers in three seconds. Simultaneously, and in secret, the US Army developed a similar project, headed by engineers J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, whose result was the first computer to valves, the Electronic Numeric Integrator And Calculator (ENIAC), able to make five hundred multiplications per second. Having been designed to calculate ballistic trajectories, ENIAC was kept secret by the US government by the end of the war, when it was announced to the world.As Zuse built the Z1?	from the calculations executed which relays data read and perforated ribbons	relays from	from the calculations executed which relays data read and perforated ribbons

536fd8c1b1a943ecb74a79aa72ff8a48	The first computer electromechanical was built by Konrad Zuse (1910-1995). In 1936, this German engineer built from relays who performed the calculations and read data on punched tape, the Z1. Zuse tried to sell the computer to the German government, which spurned the offer, since there would help in the war effort. The Zuse projects would be stopped during the war, giving a chance to the Americans to develop their computers. It was in World War II that really born today's computers. The US Navy, in conjunction with Harvard University, developed the computer Harvard Mark I, designed by Professor Howard Aiken, based on analytic calculator of Babbage. The Mark I occupied about 120m³, managing to multiply two ten-digit numbers in three seconds. Simultaneously, and in secret, the US Army developed a similar project, headed by engineers J.

In fact, the CPU executes instructions of a program for a short period of time and then switch to another program and executes some of its instructions. This creates the illusion of multiple programs running simultaneously through the CPU time sharing between programs. This time share is usually controlled by the operating system. In cases where the computer has two processing cores, each core processes information of a program, thus reducing the processing time.As the CPU executes instructions of a program?	for a short period of time and then switch to another program and executes some of its instructions	the CPU executes instructions of a program for a short period of time and then switch to another program and executes some of its instructions	executes instructions of a program for a short period of time and then switch to another program and executes some of its instructions
